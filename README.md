# parsecomb.js: Parsing combinators for JavaScript

parsecomb.js is a simple library that implements parsing combinators.
It allows you to construct parsers for arbitrary parsing expression grammars,
which are sufficient to parse almost all programming languages.

parsecomb.js is available on npm: `npm install parsecomb.js`.

See `example/arithmetic.js` for an example.
