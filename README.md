# parsecomb.js: Parsing combinators for JavaScript

parsecomb.js is a simple library that implements parsing combinators.
It allows you to construct parsers for arbitrary parsing expression grammars,
which are sufficient to parse almost all programming languages.

See `example/arithmetic.js` for an example.
